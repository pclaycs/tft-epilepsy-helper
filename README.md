# TFT Epilepsy Helper

A simple AutoHotkey script designed to help players avoid the disorienting "finisher" animations in **Teamfight Tactics**, making the game more accessible to individuals with photosensitive epilepsy.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a very simple script that:

- ❌ Does **not** provide any competitive or gameplay advantage  
- ❌ Does **not** send input (keypresses or mouse events) to the League of Legends client  
- ❌ Does **not** read from or write to League of Legends memory  
- ❌ Does **not** capture or analyze screen content  
- ❌ Does **not** inject code or modify game files  
- ✅ Only interacts with standard desktop-level window and audio controls  

The only reason I can foresee this being bannable is that **finishers are a monetized cosmetic**, and Riot Games may choose to prioritize revenue over accessibility.  
Therefore, I **cannot guarantee** that your account will not be flagged or banned for using it.  
**Use at your own risk.** I take no responsibility in the event of account penalties.
